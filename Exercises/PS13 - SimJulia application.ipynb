    "We want to investigate if adding an extra crew member during rush hour is worth our trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some relevant information:\n",
    "* The arrival time between clients $\\left(T\\right)$ is a stochastic variable following an exponential distribution with parameter $\\lambda(t)$, where $\\lambda$ also depends on the time of day. From historical data we know the following about the mean time between client arrivals:\n",
    "    * from 00:00 until 08:00: shop is closed\n",
    "    * from 08:00 until 11:00: 25 minutes\n",
    "    * from 11:00 until 14:00: 1 minutes\n",
    "    * from 14:00 until 17:00: 10 minutes\n",
    "    * from 17:00 until 19:00: 2 minutes\n",
    "    * from 19:00 until 20:00: 5 minutes\n",
    "    * from 20:00 until 24:00: shop is closed\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Remark: in reality you would execute a measurements campaign and verify if the experimental distribution actually follows an exponential distribution (by means of a Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test**\n",
    "        \n",
    "* If an employee is available the client places an order (we could also incorporate a decision time). This implies that we need the shop to have a limited `::Resource` i.e. the employees. \n",
    "\n",
    "    If no one is available, the client waits for his turn, but has a limited amount of patience. When this runs out, the clients leaves the shop (and should cancel his request for the employee `Resource`). Patience for the different clients is defined as a random variable $\\sim\\mathcal{U}(5,10)$. \n",
    "    * `Resource.level` is the current amount of resources in use\n",
    "    * `Resource.capacity` is the total amount of resources\n",
    "    * `Resource.put_queue` are the scheduled processes for the resource and can be used for queue length\n",
    "* Once the order is placed, the preperation time is also a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We need to log the activities in our shop:\n",
    "    1. Queue build-up $\\rightarrow$ logging of queue required\n",
    "    2. Waiting times $\\rightarrow$ logging of waiting times required\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some food for thought:\n",
    "* What if we considered clients with a memory? I.e. if they do not get served within their patience range, they go away and spread they word (which in its turn influences future arrival rates).\n",
    "* Is the extra person worth it from an economic point of view?\n",
    "* Could you also include orders that are place by phone before a specific time (also requiring the staff's attention)?\n",
    "*Tto get the authentic shop feeling, we could use the `Dates` package and use actual date and hour for the plots"
