    "# Cellular Automaton - Langton's Loops\n",
    "## General description\n",
    "Langton's loops are a particular \"species\" of artificial life in a 2D cellular automaton created in 1984 by Christopher Langton. They consist of a loop of cells containing genetic information, which flows continuously around the loop and out along an \"arm\" (or pseudopod), which will become the daughter loop. The \"genes\" instruct it to make three left turns, completing the loop, which then disconnects from its parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single cell has 8 possible states (0,1,...,7). Each of these values can be interpreted a shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "|state|role|color|description|\n",
    "|-----|----|-----|-----------|\n",
    "| 0 | background | black | empty state |\n",
    "| 1 | core | blue | fill tube & 'conduct' |\n",
    "| 2 | sheat | red | boundary container of the gene in the loop |\n",
    "| 3 | - | green | support left turning; bonding two arms; generating new off-shoot; cap off-shoot |\n",
    "| 4 | - | yellow | control left-turning & finishing a sprouted loop |\n",
    "| 5 | - | pink| Disconnect parent from offspring |\n",
    "| 6 | - | white | Point to where new sprout should start; guide sprout; finish sprout growth |\n",
    "| 7 | - | cyan| Hold info. on straight growth of arm & offspring |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All cells update synchronously to a new set in function of their own present state and their symmetrical [von Neumann neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood) (using a rule table cf. rules.txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule is applied symmetrically, meaning that e.g. 4 neighbours in the states 3-2-1-0 is the same as 0-3-2-1 (and all other rotations thereof).\n",

    "## Rules\n",
    "A rule e.g. '123456' is interpreted in the following way: 'Current-Top-Right-Bottom-Left-Next' i.e.  a cell currently in state 1 with neighbours 2,3,4 & 5 (and all possible rotations thereof) will become state 6 in the next iteration. The different rules can be found in `Langtonsrules.txt`.\n",

    "We split the problem in a series of subproblems:\n",
    "* transforming the rule list (.txt) to someting usable (function)\n",
    "* creating the standard layout\n",
    "* identifying the neighbours of a cel\n",
