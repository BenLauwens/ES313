    "The modern version of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method was invented in the late 1940s by Stanislaw Ulam, while he was working on nuclear weapons projects at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. He and his collegues used it to determine the critical radius (i.e. the minimal radius required for nuclear fission) of a sphere of uranium 235. You will replicate this and use simulation to determine the critical radius of $^{235}$U.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following (simplified) model for a nuclear bomb:\n",
    "* Spherical body made entirely out of $^{235}$U with a limited radius R. This model allows us to describe a neutron only by its distance from the centre and by the angle between its velocity vector and the radius.\n",
    "* A neutron starts at the center of the sphere with a given velocity and a random direction.\n",
    "* Whilst in the sphere, any of the following events can happen:\n",
    "    * fission: current neutron ‘dies’ and 2 (55%) or 3 (45%) new ones appear.\n",
    "    * absorption: the neutron is absorbed by the sphere.\n",
    "    * reflection: the neutron is reflected in a random direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neutron multiplication factor:\n",
    "A numerical measure of a critical mass is dependent on the effective neutron multiplication factor $k$, the average number of neutrons released per fission event that go on to cause another fission event rather than being absorbed or leaving the material. When $k = 1$, the mass is critical, and the chain reaction is self-sustaining.\n",

For this application, no we do not consider larger (and much more expensive) drones that have stand-off weapons (e.g. missiles).\n",

A person that gets on the metro has a probability to choose one of the destinations. You can use historical data to determine these (or your own experience for lack of data).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some advanced food for thought:\n",
    "* The build-up of people at each stop may depend on the time of day. Optimize the subway frequency to avoid people having to wait.\n",
    "* Include more or less frequented stations, include delays linked to people trying to go above the maximal train capacity and the subsequent build-up of people and increased waiting times for the other stops.\n",

    "#### Some background:\n",
    "In Brussels we have trains that are of the type BOA ([N](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOA_(Brusselse_metro) ) / [F](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boa_(STIB) ) ) and have a total capacity of $196+532$ places.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main variables come into play with respect to punctuality:\n",
    "1. Runnning time: the trajectory time between two subsequent stops. In general this show less variability than the dwell times since they depend mainly on technical restrictions.\n",
    "2. Dwell time: the time the train occupies the station. This is a random process that depends on the number and behaviour of the passengers as well as the action of closing the door and departure/take-off carried out manually by the drivers. In addition, these dwell times depend on the physical design of the station (width and length of the station, accesses to the platforms, etc.), since the passengers can concentrate in certain points of the station making access to the train difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "The passengers' arrival to the metro stations is also a random process, and the number of passengers waiting in the station for a train increases with the time interval between consecutive trains. If no control action is applied, when a delayed train arrives the number of passengers waiting at the station is increased, thus dwell time could be greater than nominal and the train delay increases also. This accumulated effect makes the system unstable, provoking, in turn, delays in the following trains and disruptions in the functioning of the line. These imbalances have to be corrected by means of control actions."

    "## 15. Artillery wargaming\n",
    "We want to review current artilley field manuals for GIAT LG1 howitzer. This system has a calibre of 105 mm and can fire up to 12 shots per minute, with a range of 11.5 km (with conventional ammunition) or 14.9 km (with special 'Long-Range' ammunition). \n",
    "\n",
    "We look at a typical use case such as artillery barrage on an infantry platoon. Investigate the impact of a barrage on an infantry platoon in terms of hit probability for different configurations. Because a wounded soldier is a lot more impacting than a dead one, focus the analysis on getting hit by shrapnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Think about:\n",
    "* the amount of shots to fire to obtain a certain degree of destruction (or the invers: have a look at survival rates)\n",
    "* combining different canons, their effect and the way they are given firing instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some background:\n",
    "* Artillery usage is subject to several errors. We will neglect acquisition errors (coördinates of the target) and suppose the gunners orient the gun correctly.\n",
    "* Circular error probability (CEP) is a measure of a weapon system's precision. It is defined as the radius of a circle, centered on the mean, whose boundary is expected to include the landing points of 50% of the rounds. The CEP of the GIAT is 50m. I.e. if we fire at a specific point, 50% of all impacts will be in a 50m radius around the aim point. You can use a [bivariate normal distribution](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BivariateNormalDistribution.html) to simulate the impact location (implemented in the [Distributions](https://juliastats.github.io/Distributions.jl/latest/multivariate.html#Distributions-1) package ).\n",
    "* An artillery shell can kill/wound in two ways: with the blast on the one hand and with the shrapnell on the other. Shrapnel leads to more injuries than the explosion itself. The probability of getting hit by a piece of shrapnel can be approximate by the ratio of the area of the shell that is fragmented by the projected area.\n",
    "* with respect to the explosion and the associaten overpressure we know the following: within an 11m radius of the point of impact you are almost certain to die. Between 11m and 15m there is a 35% chance of dying. Beyond 15m you will survive the explosion itself, but likely have some injury due to the fragments.\n",
    "* A piece of artillery rarely works alone, you can use a platoon (4 canons) or a battery (12 canons) to maximise the effectiveness.\n"
