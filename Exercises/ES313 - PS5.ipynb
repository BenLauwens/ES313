    "### Markov analysis\n",
    "A series of random words seldom makes sense because there is no relationship between successive words. For example, in a real sentence you would expect an article like “the” to be followed by an adjective or a noun, and probably not a verb or adverb.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to measure these kinds of relationships is Markov analysis, which characterizes, for a given sequence of words, the probability of the words that might come next. For example, the song Eric, the Half a Bee begins:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Half a bee, philosophically,\n",
    "Must, ipso facto, half not be.\n",
    "But half the bee has got to be\n",
    "Vis a vis, its entity. D’you see?\n",
    "\n",
    "But can a bee be said to be\n",
    "Or not to be an entire bee\n",
    "When half the bee is not a bee\n",
    "Due to some ancient injury?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this text, the phrase “half the” is always followed by the word “bee”, but the phrase “the bee” might be followed by either “has” or “is”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of Markov analysis is a mapping from each prefix (like “half the” and “the bee”) to all possible suffixes (like “has” and “is”). suffix)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this mapping, you can generate a random text by starting with any prefix and choosing at random from the possible suffixes. Next, you can combine the end of the prefix and the new suffix to form the next prefix, and repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you start with the prefix “Half a”, then the next word has to be “bee”, because the prefix only appears once in the text. The next prefix is “a bee”, so the next suffix might be “philosophically”, “be” or “due”.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task(s)\n",
    "* Design an application that takes a text and performs a Markov analysis for a sequence of words. The length $n$ of the sequence should be a variable.\n",
    "    * You should register not only the possible word to come next, but also its frequency\n",
    "* Design an application that, for a given sequence, returns the next word, based on the probabilities that you derive from the frequencies (the word should be chosen at random, taking into account the probabilities.\n",
    "* Use the two tools you just built to generate a random text, based on $n$ starting words of a given length $N$\n",
    "    * Try it out on the poem, is the result as expected?\n",
