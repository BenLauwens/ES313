    "### Optimal course planning\n",
    "Suppose a professor teaches a course with $N=20$ lectures. We must decide how to split each lecture between theory and applications. Let $T_i$ and $A_i$ denote the fraction of the i$^{\\text{th}}$ lecture devoted to theory and applications, for $i=1,\\dots,N$. We can already determine the following: $T_i \\ge 0,A_i \\ge 0$ and $T_i+A_i =1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may know from experience, you need to cover a certain amount of theory before you can start doing applications. For this application consider the following model:\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i \\le \\phi \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} T_i \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We interpret $\\phi(u)$ as the cumulative amount of applications that can be covered, when the cumulative amount of theory covered is $u$. We will use the simple form $\\phi(u) = a(u − b)$, with $a=2, b=3$, which means that no applications can be covered until $b$ lectures of the theory are covered; after that, each lecture of theory covered opens the possibility of covering a lecture on applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phychological studies have shown that the theory-applications split affects the emotional state of students differently. Let $s_i$ l denote the emotional state of a student after lecture $i$, with $s_i = 0$ meaning neutral, $s_i > 0$ meaning happy, and $s_i < 0$ meaning unhappy. Careful studies have shown that $s_i$ evolves via a linear recursion dynamic:\n",

    "\n",
    "Questions:\n",
    "1. Determine the optimal split that leads to the most positive emotional state (for $\\theta = 0.05, \\alpha = -0.1, \\beta = 1.4$);\n",
    "2. Show the course repartition graphically\n",
    "3. Determine values for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ that lead to a neutral result at the end of the course. Can you give an interpretation to these values?"
