    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous lecture, all iterates of the simplex method are basic feasible points and therefore vertices of the feasible polytope. Most steps consists of a move from one vertex to an adjacent one. On most steps (but not all), the value of the objective function $\\vec{c}^\\mathsf{T}\\vec x$ is decreased. Another type of step occurs when the problem is unbounded: the step is an edge along which the objective funtion is reduced, andalong which we can move infinitely far without reaching a vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major issue at each simplex iteration is to decide which index to remove from the basic index set $\\mathcal B$. Unless the step is a direction of unboundness, a single index must be removed from $\\mathcal B$ and replaced by another from outside $\\mathcal B$. We can gain some insight into how this decision is made by looking again at the KKT conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, define the nonbasic index set $\\mathcal N = \\left\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\right\\} \\setminus \\mathcal B$.

    "In linear programming, as in all optimization problems in which inequality constraints are present, the fundamental task of the algorithm is to determine which of these constraints are active at the solution and which are inactive. The simplex method belongs to a general class of algorithms for constrained optimization known as _active set methods_, which explicitly maintain estimates of the active and inactive index sets that are updated at each step of the algorithm. (At each iteration, the basis $\\mathcal B$ is our current estimate of the inactive set, that is, the set of indices $i$ for which we suspect that $x_i > 0$ at the\n",
    "solution of the linear program.) Like most active set methods, the simplex method makesonly modest changes to these index sets at each step; a single index is exchanged between $\\mathcal B$ into $\\mathcal N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One undesirable feature of the simplex method attracted attention from its earliest days. Though highly efficient on almost all practical problems (the method generally requires at most $2m$ to $3m$ iterations, where $m$ is the row dimension of the constraint matrix, there are pathological problems on which the algorithm performs very poorly. The complexity of the simplex method is _exponential_, roughly speaking, its running time may be an exponential function of the dimension of\n",
    "the problem. For many years, theoreticians searched for a linear programming algorithm that has polynomial complexity, that is, an algorithm in which the running time is bounded by a polynomial function of the amount of storage required to define the problem.\n",

    "In the mid-1980s, Karmarkar described a polynomial algorithm that approaches the solution through the interior of the feasible polytope rather than working its way around the boundary as the simplex method does."
