# ES313 - Quickstart guide
We made sure that the installation and configuration runs as smoothly as possible with a minimum of effort on your part. These guidelines work for both Windows and MacOS. Occasionally there is a small difference between the platforms that will be made clear during this walktrough.

This guide has been successfully tested on Windows 10, Windows 8.1, MacOS El Capitan & Mac OS Mojave.

It is recommended that you do all this before attending class, because the installation might take a while. A speedy internet connection is an added value.


## General overview
1. Download Julia 1.2 for your platform from the [website](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
2. Install Julia 1.2
3. Download the `ES313 config.zip` from GitHub and extract the zip file in a folder of your choice.
4. Navigate to the extracted folder. If you are a MAc user, execute `ES313 - MAC.command`. If you are a Windows user, execute `ES313 - WINDOWS.bat`. This small script should activate Julia, fetch all relevant updates, install the required packages and open a new Jupyter Lab home screen.
5. Enjoy the course

*Remarks:*
    
- The first time you run this script, the installer might ask you is you want to install MiniConda (valid for both platforms). This is required for proper functioning of Jupyter. Say 'yes' when prompted.
- On windows, you might get a warning that Windows Defender has blocked the execution of the script. This can be solved (see images below)
