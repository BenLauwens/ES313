The vector inequality $\\vec x\\ge\\vec 0$ means that each component of $\\vec x$ is nonnegative. Several variations of this problem are possible; eg. instead of minimizing, we can maximize, or the constraints may be in the form of inequalities, such as $\\mathbf A\\vec x\\ge \\vec b$ or $\\mathbf A\\vec x\\le\\vec b$. We shall see later, these variations can all be rewritten into the standard form.  "
